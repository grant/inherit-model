# inherit-model

A simple Backbone-inspired model wrapper for the `inherit` package

## Why?

- Universal getter and setter methods `get` and `set`. Don't have 100s of getters and setters.
- Don't accidentally set properties of classes that aren't defined again. Fields are strict.
- Easy default fields.
- Keeps things lightweight.

## Install

```bash
npm install inherit-model --save
```
